Temperature controlled fan regulator.
Most smartfans are costlier and the old fans needs to be replaced completely for a new smartfan.
The common features of smartfan are they change speed according to temperatures and can be controlled by bluetooth.
Here ,my plan is to control the regulator of a fan and not change the entire fan to a smartfan.
By using a stepper motor ,8051 microcontroller and a bluetooth module ,we could easily create a portable regulator which acts as smartfan accessory.
By adding a dht sensor to detect temperature and make the stepper motor to control the regulator of the fan we could automatically change the speed of fan with change in temperature.
This can also be removed and fixed on any fan regulators over the switch board and it would work.
This acts as a smartfan without any replacement or high cost and it can be removed antime and moved anywhere.
This is not a finalized version of my project.
